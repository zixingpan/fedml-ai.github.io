# Algorithm Reference Implementations

Note: If you published a algorithm paper in top-tier ML/AI conferences (ICML/NeurIPS/ICLR/CVPR/ACL, etc), we advocate you to transplant your code our FedML framework.
You won't cost too much time, we will have engineers and researchers to help with this integration.
